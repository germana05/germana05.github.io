                <h2>Who am I</h2>
                <p>My name is Marshall Verboekend and I am a 21 year old student. I currently am in my third year of Software Developer Games. My hobbies are playing soccer, going to the gym and gaming. My whole life I have played soccer at VV Hoogezand and I am still playing. I currently am in the JO23-1 but struggling with injuries. Just like soccer I have played games my whole life but in many different ways like on pc and playstation but boardgames as well. Because of my love for games I chose to study software developer games so I could work on games that I like to play and which can make people happy.</p>

                <h2>My Life</h2>
                <p>I'm 21 and still live at home with my parents. It gives me the space to focus on my passion creating games. I've always been into games, but now I find it even more exciting to make them myself. The process of creating something that others can play and learn from is really amazing. Besides making games I also love to travel and spend time with family and friends. I have visited a lot of countries like Spain, Croatia, Greece, Denmark and many more.</p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>Over the last 3 years I have gained a lot of experience in coding. I have learned to make games in unity using c# but besides that I have learned Unreal Engine and a part of HTML, CSS, Java and Blender. I am still in the learning and I know I need to learn much more but I am eager to learn it and want to become a big programmer. Besides the programming I also have some experience in photographing because of an course through my education.</p>

                <h2>My Skills</h2>
                <p>I'm quite good in C#, which I often use for programming and creating applications. Additionally, I work a lot with Blender for 3D modeling, and I also have experience with Unity and Unreal Engine for game development. In the field of web development, I'm strong in HTML and CSS, and I also have some basic knowledge of JavaScript, which I use to create simple interactive elements for websites.</p>
